This is just a small hobby project site for my friends and family, to make simple things free. If you find something here to help solving your problem, in the end if it saves your time, that would be my pleasure.

I'm a software engineer. I believe software engineer is one of rare jobs that they can actually enjoy as profession and hobby at the same time. I'm a backend engineer and I see things differently than most people, and I have very little things that I can actually help them. However, I see opportunites that I can try AI to create tools, since the internet has tons of garbages.

I hope this site provides clean, simple, and mostly Free solutions for simple problems. I wish this to become a goto site for them. And this is just a beginning. I'm not sure how much time I can spend here, or I can actually do as I thought. We'll see.

For disclaimer, tools here could be broken at any point of time. I would not take any responsibility in using them. But I would appreciate any feedbacks and suggestions. Or you can provide a pull request :D.

Thanks. Jake

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
