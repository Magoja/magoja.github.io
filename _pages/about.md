This is just a small hobby project site for my friends and family, to make simple things free. If you find something here to help solving your problem, in the end if it saves your time, that would be my pleasure.


I'm a software engineer. I believe software engineering is one of the rare jobs that you can actually enjoy as both a profession and a hobby. I'm a backend engineer and I see things differently than most people, and there are very few things where I can actually help them. However, I see opportunities to try AI to create tools, since the internet has tons of garbage.


I hope this site provides clean, simple, and mostly free solutions for everyday problems. I wish for this to become a go-to site for them. And this is just the beginning. I'm not sure how much time I can spend here, or what I can actually accomplish as I imagined. We'll see.


Disclaimer: The tools here could be broken at any point in time. I do not take any responsibility for their use. But I would appreciate any feedback and suggestions. Or you can submit a pull request :D.

Thanks,
Jake

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
